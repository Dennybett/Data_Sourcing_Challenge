### Geomagnetic Storms Prediction

#### Project description


During this project, I have prepared a dataset for a predicition system that will help in the prediction of Geomagnetic storms.

 Geomagnetic storms which are caused by Coronal Mass Ejections(CME) from the sun, are to be studied as they can be harmful to us by affecting electronic devices such as satellites, GPS systems, and other essential parts of our powergrid.

During this project, data is extracted from the NASA API, specifically the GST and the CME datas. The data is then merged together to compute the average time it takes for a CME to cause a GST.

The data extracted can then be used for further research, and projects such as in creating predictions using Machine Learning models.
